# Charon - Space Rescue Gauntlet Game

> A blockchain-based space combat and rescue simulation game built on Starknet using the Dojo engine. Every ship is a unique NFT with distinct stats and history.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Charon is a player-vs-player space combat game where creators design dangerous rescue gauntlets and challengers attempt to complete them. Think of it as "create your own death run" in space - with real stakes and real NFT ownership.

### Core Concept

**Creators** stake tokens to design rescue missions by:
1. Placing a **rescue target NFT ship** at specific coordinates
2. Strategically positioning enemy NFT ships and stations across the grid

**Rescuers** pay an entry fee to attempt the mission with their own NFT ships. If rescuers reach the target ship and complete the rescue, they win the reward and potentially the target ship. If they fail, the creator keeps their fee. The better balanced your gauntlet (hard but fair), the more attempts you'll get!

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **NFT Ship Ownership**
- **Every ship is a unique NFT** with individual stats and combat history
- Ships can be traded, sold, or lost in failed rescues

### 2. **Rescue Gauntlet System**
- Creators place a **rescue target ship** at specific grid coordinates
- Strategic enemy ship and station placement around the target

- Reach the rescue target coordinates
- Extract the target ship to win

**3. Claim Your Reward**
- **Win**: Collect rescue reward + creator's stake + **rescue target ship NFT**

- **Your ship gains battle history** regardless of outcome

## üèÜ NFT Ship Mechanics

### Ship Identity
Each ship is a unique NFT with:
- Unique ContractAddress as identifier
- Current owner tracking
- Associated gauntlet/mission history
- Faction allegiance
- Ship class designation
- Individual stats, ammo, fuel levels
- Battle damage and repair history

### Ship Value Factors
- **Base class rarity** (Battleships > Corvettes)
- **Faction bonuses applied**
- **Battle history and victories**
- **Current condition** (hull, shields, ammo)
- **Upgrades and modifications** (future feature)

### Rescue Target Ship
- Placed by creator at specific (x, y) coordinates
- Acts as the "finish line" for rescuers
- Becomes prize if rescue succeeds
- Can be any ship class (affects gauntlet value)
- Creator risks losing valuable ship for higher rewards

### Ship Trading
- Open marketplace for buying/selling NFT ships
- Battle-proven ships command premium prices
- Rare faction/class combinations highly valued
- Damaged ships sold at discount (require repairs)

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Project Structure

**Models Layer**
- Game state management
- Rescue gauntlet configuration with target ship location
- Ship NFT entities with unique ContractAddress identifiers
- Ship and station composition tracking
- Mini-zone spatial indexing

**Systems Layer**
- Rescue gauntlet creation and management
- Ship spawning and lifecycle management
- Rescue attempt logic (in development)
- Combat resolution system (planned)

**Utils Layer**
- Credit helper: Tier calculations and composition generation
- Armament helper: Ship stat initialization with faction modifiers

### Key Components

**Ship NFT Model**
Every ship is a unique NFT containing:
- Unique identifier (ContractAddress)
- Owner address
- Gauntlet association
- Faction and class
- Combat statistics (hull, shields, speed, crew)
- Armament (railguns, torpedoes, PDCs)
- Resources (fuel, reactor power, ammunition)
- Spatial coordinates

**Rescue Gauntlet Model**
Gauntlet configurations include:
- Rescue target ship NFT identifier
- Target location coordinates
- Creator information and stakes
- Reward pool and entry fees
- Difficulty settings (credits, mortality level)
- Threat budget allocation
- Attempt tracking and success rates

**Ship Composition**
Tracks enemy ship placement:
- Ship count by class
- Individual ship NFT identifiers
- Spatial distribution
- Threat cost calculations

**Station Composition**
Tracks defensive station placement:
- Station count by type
- Strategic positioning
- Combined threat values

## üìê Game Balance

### Threat Budget Formula
Base Budget: 50 points plus bonus calculated as (Credits / 10) √ó 5 points

**Example**: 750 credits yields 50 + (750/10 √ó 5) = 425 threat points

### Rescue Target Value Impact
- **Higher value target ships** attract more rescuers
- **Rare ship classes** justify higher entry fees
- **Creator risk vs reward** balancing target value with stakes

### Economic Equilibrium
Optimal success rate targets 20-40% for maximum profitability:
- Enough failures for creator to profit from entry fees
- Enough successes to maintain rescuer interest
- Total creator risk includes both stake and target ship value

### NFT Ship Lifecycle
Ships progress through: Mint ‚Üí Gauntlet Placement ‚Üí Combat ‚Üí Survival/Damage ‚Üí Repair ‚Üí Trading/Reuse (or Loss/Destruction)

## üéØ Design Philosophy

> "Every ship tells a story. Every rescue is a gamble. The best gauntlets aren't impossible - they're *almost* survivable. That sweet spot between challenge and fairness is where fortunes are made, and legends are born."

Charon rewards strategic thinking over grinding. Creators must balance difficulty to attract attempts while protecting their valuable rescue target ships. Rescuers must master ship management, risk assessment, and decide which of their NFT ships to risk on each mission. The blockchain ensures transparency, true ownership, and fair play.

**Your ships are yours. Your victories are permanent. Your losses matter.**
